# Initial considerations

## **Purpose**

It’s hard to know exactly what a dataset can tell you until you’ve seen what’s in it. But starting with a few key questions can help you focus and choose the right data to analyze. With so many data points available, it can get overwhelming without a clear idea of what you’re looking for. The list below shows some areas you can explore using the tools mentioned in this document. 

-   The yearly amount of money spent on APCs. 

-   The yearly amount saved through discounts and memberships. 

-   Type of OA model most prevalent, including the type of open licensed assigned to articles

-   The number of articles added/not added to your institutional repository. 

-   When the article was added to an OA repository using the oa-date and repository information from Unpaywall. This could yield interesting details on faculty processes for making content OA (e.g. pre-publication, post-publication, etc.)

-   Analyze the subject areas and faculties/departments where open access publishing is occurring/not occurring. This could assist with advocacy and outreach opportunities to promote OA.

-   The largest OA outputs by publisher. This could lead to negotiations around further discounts or moving toward transformative agreements.

-   Using the corresponding author data, gather emails for a research project on faculty OA practices.

-   Track and compare the impact of OA agreements over time. For example, if the Public Library of Science (PLOS) agreement started in 2023, tracking publications and comparing them with past years will show whether there is an increase in PLOS publications after the transformative agreement.

-   Evaluate agreements for the OA Collection team to identify how much your institution publishes with the publisher. This will help guide what we consider for purchasing when we get requests.

-   Identify SSHRC/NSERC/CIHR-funded research meeting the OA requirements

## **Resources**

Resourcing for data refining and analysis needs to be considered to ensure you are scoping your project appropriately.  The resources of time, people, training, and tools will impact what you can accomplish and will affect the “questions” you can answer with your dataset. 

The workflows described here are meant to guide how to gather and analyze data based on the resources available to you at your institution. With this in mind, we offer both a scaled-down and scaled-up workflow in the second part of this document.  

The following sections outline key considerations on resourcing your data project.

#### **People & Time**

With more time, the more detailed and comprehensive the dataset will be. 

Time for data pulling if using multiple datasets and merging. 

Time for data cleaning and refinement. 

Exactness of the data takes time (gathering exact APC costs over estimates). 

More staff/librarian support, the more work can be done on the data.

#### **Training**

Knowledge needed to complete the analysis - excel/open refine/R maybe

#### **Tools**

Choosing the right tool is the first step in collecting and analyzing data. No single tool covers everything, and each has its limits and biases that can affect your results. It’s important to be aware of these early on, so you can adjust for them and mention them in your report. For example, Web of Science lacks many arts and social science journals. To get better coverage, you might combine it with OpenAlex, which includes more of these areas. If you do, make sure to note this in your reporting.

The table below highlights the commonly used tools, their data coverage, and commonly known limitations and biases in the dataset.

As a result, we had to work with RP (Reprint Address) to try to identify articles that have a corresponding author from UBC. Instead of relying on UBC email addresses, we had to rely on UBC mailing addresses. Either methodology presents challenges, as authors may give their personal address or email. In review of the test dataset, relying on the reprint address was deemed a reasonable method based on overall capture. |

## **Reporting**

Before starting your data collection and analysis, keep track of any decisions or compromises you make. This helps ensure your findings are clear and accurate for your audience. For example, if you use estimated article processing charges (APCs) instead of exact prices, note this in your report, ideally in a footnote or appendix. Tracking these details also makes it easier to repeat your process for future or yearly reports, especially if you plan to do a long-term study.

Commonly tracked decisions and compromises include:

## **Additional Considerations**

#### **CRKN APC Data**

If your institution is a part of the consortial agreements with the Canadian Research Knowledge Network (CRKN). In that case, publishers with agreements provide them with data on authors who have taken advantage of the OA agreements. The citation data provided includes institutional APC savings from the agreements. Using these reports from publishers XXX; however, any OA agreements outside of the CRKN consortial agreements will need to be extracted from elsewhere.
